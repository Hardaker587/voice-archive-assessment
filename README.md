Build a _open bar tap_ web app in your preferred frontend framework. React is recommended but any framework is allowed. The web app should be as slim as possible, but cover the following:

1. As a user I want a view that lists 3 different kinds of beers
2. As a user I should be be able to enter how many of each type of beer I want for a "round of drinks"
4. As a user I should be able to submit/add the specificed order or beers to my open tab
5. As a user I want to, optionally, enter how many people will split the total bill
6. As a user I want to, at any time, be able to request the total of my bill - including a price per. person, if applicable

### Beers on tap

| Beer | Price |
|--|--|
| Lager | DKK 45.00 |
| IPA | DKK 52.00 |
| Weissbier | DKK 59.00 |
